# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
# With Focus on Theater and Play Projects

In an effort to assist Louise in researching how how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals, we have compiled data from several Kickstarter campaigns, focusing on theater and play projects, in an effort to find corolations, if any. 

## Ideal Launch Dates For Theater Kickstarters

Based on the following chart outlining successful, failed, and canceled theater Kickstarters, early summer months are ideal for launching new theater projects.

The month of May, in particular, had the most successful campaign launches with June coming in second. 

## Analysis of Outcome vs Funding Goal

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/BPeaver/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

While no funding goal amount seems to guarentee a 100% chance of success, goals under $15,000 and between $35,000 and $45,000 offer the greatest chance of successful funding. Choosing a low-budget goal or a mid-tier goal seems to be the most likely to earn full funding. 

## Challenges

While no challenges were encountered in the analysis of this data set, it is possible that errors could be encountered while running the =Countsif function and trying to copy formula to save time. Simply dragging or auto-filling the boxes will cause issues as it will shift the target cells from the Kickstarter dataset as it shifts columns. 

## Results

Using the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date worksheet, one can discern that summer months offer the best time to target for a launch. Possible reasons for this could be more travel and vacation time for people, post-tax season returns providing people with more excess cash to put toward supporting Kickstarters, or just a general desire to "do something" during the warmer months of the year. However, winter months do not yield the same results, with a steady decling in successful launches as the holidays approach, possibly due to disposable income and cash being needed for holiday spending. 

Reviewing the data from the Outcomes vs Goals data, it makes sense that lower-cost Kickstarters would achieve successful funding. Also, as funding needs go up, it is also logical that the failure percentage would also go up. However, the $35,000 to $45,000 window that sees successes outweigh failures is an oddity. 

Moving forward, it would be useful to see a collection of keywords (i.e. love, family, coming of age) tied to the descriptions of the Kickstarters that could be sorted and searched. This would allow us to see if certain keywords and subject matters are likely to recieve support regardless of funding needs. Perhaps using a pie chart of these key phrases in successful Kickstarter campaigns would show us what proves to be the most popular. Also, this information in a bar graph would work much the same.
